Description: An application for students to record and calculate user grades. It has no backend.
There are no passwords, just usernames. A user's data is stored on the computer
it is ran on.

Installation Instructions:
-Download the repo
-run through Launcher.java
-not all tests in GradeTrackerTests can be run because some require accounts with
loaded data, which requires putting certain account data into these accounts through the GUI 
(or through the user info folder ), but I am not putting those accounts in the repo.
